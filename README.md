# yard-sale-helper

### CS2340 Project
###### Note: Instead of pushing to master, please push to branch 'develop'. This is to prevent the master branch from being polluted when mistakes are made.

###### Important! Each time you want to run the app using 'activator run', do this first:  
###### rhc port-forward -a yardsalehelper
###### Then open a new console inside the command line to activator run the app

### Git Instruction 
Clone a specific branch (e.g. develop): git clone -b develop remote_repo_url **Don't omit -b**  
Check what branch you are on, and your progress: git status  
Create a new branch: git branch branch_name  
Switch to another branch: git checkout branch_name  
  
While working inside the folder cloned from openshift:
Push to specific branch on gt github(e.g. develop): git push gt HEAD:develop  
  
Merge local feature branch with local develop branch:  
git checkout develop (switch to develop branch)  
git merge feature_branch
